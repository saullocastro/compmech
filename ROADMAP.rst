Version 0.6.0
-------------
- skew panel with formulation for stringers not aligned with the panel
  longitudinal direction
- put matrices for cones and cylinders in the new format and unify their
  calculation as we did for compmech.panel
- robustness of sparse-solver for the panel module, it is really a pain to use
  the dense solver because of the relative slowness...
- tune eigenvalue solver for freq in compmech.panel, similarly to what has
  been done for linear buckling analysis....
- add Third-Order Shear Deformation Theory to deal with many papers using
  shear correction factors
- finish implementing compmech.plate for Monteiro

Version 1.0.0 (long term)
--------------------------
- finite element solver
