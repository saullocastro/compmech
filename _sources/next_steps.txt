Use of Finite Elements
----------------------

The studies with the Ritz Method presented in module
:mod:`compmech.conecyl` have shown the main disadvantages regarding
the numerical integration of the non-linear stiffness matrices:

- since the approximation functions are complex, the evaluation of each
  integration point is expensive

- there is no quadrature rule available for such complex functions

Moreover, the use of very especialized models makes it difficult to extend
their applicability for different cases where different load and boundary
conditions are desired.

The use of finite elements will allow the use of simpler approximation
functions significantly reducing the computational cost to evaluate each 
integration point, and allowing the application of quadrature rules,
minimizing the number of integration points required.

Building the Spine
..................

Before implementing the new finite elements a very well defined process 
must be stablished in order to define:

- integration with pynastran to read NASTRAN input files

- define node class

- define element class

- node-element connectivity schemes
    - minimize band-width of the stiffness matrices by working with a proper
      internal node identification. The user will use the conventional node ID,
      but the analysis could use an internal ID that is calculated to minimize
      the band-width of the sparse matrices

- use of C++, C or Cython?
    - use Cython or Python classes?

- possible sparse solvers:
  - Intel MKL PARDISO
  - the ``scipy.sparse`` solver, at least to build the ``csr_matrix`` or 
    ``csc_matrix``
  - SuperLU
  - ARPACK (used in ``scipy.sparse.linalg.eigsh``)
  - Use the rainflow algorithm?

- Use SIMD programming for common array operations?
  - rely on NumPy, with a group working on these optimizations
  - use Eigen3 wrappers such as minieigen

Developing New Elements
.......................

The element types should include some of those available in NASTRAN plus 
some additional options:

- The priority order should be:
  
  - QUAD4 (plate element)
  - ZQUAD4 (cylindrical shell element)
  - CQUAD4 (conical shell element - certain confusion with NASTRAN CQUAD4)
  - 1-D elements
  - 3-D elements

- The element's formulation should allow:
  - Initial Imperfection (how!)
  - CLPT
  - FSDT
  - TSDT

Studies
.......

The new tools will create a high potential for new studies concerning 
advanced procedures to calculate shear correction factors, new non-linear
methods and so on...
