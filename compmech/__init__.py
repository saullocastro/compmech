.. currentmodule:: compmech

Python-based toolkit for computational mechanics.

The compmech package contains semi-analytical routines for linear buckling,
linear static and non-linear static analysis of unstiffened cylindrical and
conical shells (:mod:`.compmech.conecyl`), and panels
(:mod:`.compmech.panels`). The implementation is based on Python and the low
level routines are programmed in Cython.
