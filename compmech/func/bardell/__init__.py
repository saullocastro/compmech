.. currentmodule:: compmech.func.bardell

This module contains useful methods based on the
:ref:`hierarchical functions developed by Bardell <theory_func_bardell>`.

Currently, the `.pyx` files should be called in through the use of Cython's
``include`` command, which is not recommended, but works very well.
