Computational Mechanics (compmech)
==================================

The compmech package contains semi-analytical routines for the analyses:

- linear buckling
- linear static
- non-linear static
- linear flutter
- linear vibration

for:

- unstiffened cylindrical and conical shells
- stiffened and unstiffened panels and plates

The implementation is based on Python and the low level routines are
programmed in C and Cython.

The details about the theory and the implementations of all tools are given in
:ref:`the theoretical part of the documentation <theory>`.
