Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) Theories
######################################

Reddy (2004) [reddy2004]_ defines two main group of models
used to simulated laminated composite materials, the 3-D models and the 
2-D models where the real three-dimensional structure is treated as a
two-dimensional shell that translates and rotates. 

The ESL theories are those using the 2-D kinematic assumption 
and many models are derived, depending how the in-plane strains are changing
along the shell thickness.

Among the ESL models, the Classical Laminated Plate Theory (CLPT) and the
First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) will be further detailed in the
sections below.
